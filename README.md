# MPG Model

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a simple machine learning model that predicts a car's fuel efficiency (Miles Per Gallon - MPG) based on various vehicle attributes using the **Auto MPG dataset**. It uses Python’s `scikit-learn` library to create a Linear Regression model and visualize the results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the **miles per gallon (MPG)** of cars using a **Linear Regression** model. The workflow includes:
- Loading and cleaning the dataset.
- Training a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- Saving the trained model as a `.pkl` file.
- Generating predictions and saving them in a CSV file.
- Visualizing the comparison between predicted and actual MPG values.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of implementing regression techniques in Python and understanding model evaluation through visualization.
